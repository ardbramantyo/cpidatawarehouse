,F.time_month AS contract_month
,A.job_id
,A.unit_price
,A.quantity_ordered
,SUM(D.invoice_amount) AS sum_invoice_amount
,SUM(D.invoice_quantity) AS sum_invoice_quantity
FROM w_job_f A
JOIN w_sub_job_f B ON A.job_id = B.job_id
JOIN w_job_shipment_f C ON B.sub_job_id = C.sub_job_id
JOIN w_invoiceline_f D ON C.invoice_id = D.invoice_id
JOIN w_location_d E ON A.location_id = E.location_id
JOIN w_time_d F ON A.contract_date = F.time_id
GROUP BY
 A.location_id
,E.location_name
,F.time_year
,F.time_month
,A.job_id
,A.unit_price
,A.quantity_ordered
ORDER BY
 A.location_id
